# yt-fts - YouTube Full Text Search 
`yt-fts` is a command line program that uses [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) to scrape all of a YouTube 
channels subtitles and load them into a sqlite database that is searchable from the command line. It allows you to
query a channel for specific key word or phrase and will generate time stamped YouTube urls to
the video containing the keyword. 

It also supports semantic search via the [OpenAI embeddings API](https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference/), [Gemini embedding API](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/embeddings) and using [chromadb](https://github.com/chroma-core/chroma).

## Installation 

pip 

```bash
pip install yt-fts
```

## Commands

### `download`
Download subtitles for a channel or playlist. 

Takes a channel or playlist URL as an argument. Specify the number of jobs to parallelize the download with the `--jobs` flag. 
Use the `--cookies-from-browser` to use cookies from your browser in the requests, will help if you're getting errors 
that request you to sign in. You can also run the `update` command several times to gradually get more videos into the database. 

```bash
# Download channel
yt-fts download --jobs 5 "https://www.youtube.com/@3blue1brown"
yt-fts download --cookies-from-browser firefox "https://www.youtube.com/@3blue1brown"

# Download playlist
yt-fts download --playlist "https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab"
```

**Options:**
- `-p, --playlist`: Download all videos from a playlist
- `-l, --language`: Language of the subtitles to download (default: en)
- `-j, --jobs`: Number of parallel download jobs (default: 8, recommended: 4-16)
- `--cookies-from-browser`: Browser to extract cookies from (chrome, firefox, etc.)

### `diagnose`
Diagnose 403 errors and other download issues.

This command will test various aspects of the connection to YouTube and provide recommendations for fixing common issues.

```bash
yt-fts diagnose
yt-fts diagnose --test-url "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ" --cookies-from-browser firefox
```

**Options:**

- `--cookies-from-browser`: Browser to extract cookies from
- `-j, --jobs`: Number of parallel download jobs to test with (default: 8)

### `list`
List saved channels, videos, and transcripts.

The (ss) next to the channel name indicates that the channel has semantic search enabled. 

```bash
# List all channels
yt-fts list

# List videos for a specific channel
yt-fts list --channel "3Blue1Brown"

# Show transcript for a specific video
yt-fts list --transcript "dQw4w9WgXcQ"

yt-fts list --library
```

**Options:**
- `-t, --transcript`: Show transcript for a video
- `-c, --channel`: Show list of videos for a channel
- `-l, --library`: Show list of channels in library

### `update`
Update subtitles for all channels in the library or a specific channel. 

Keep in mind some might not have subtitles enabled. This command will still attempt to download subtitles as subtitles are sometimes added later.

```bash
# Update all channels
yt-fts update

# Update specific channel
yt-fts update --channel "3Blue1Brown" --jobs 5
```

**Options:**
- `-c, --channel`: The name or id of the channel to update
- `-l, --language`: Language of the subtitles to download (default: en)
- `-j, --jobs`: Number of parallel download jobs (default: 8)
- `--cookies-from-browser`: Browser to extract cookies from

### `delete`
Delete a channel and all its data.

You must provide the name or the id of the channel you want to delete. The command will ask for confirmation before performing the deletion.

```bash
yt-fts delete --channel "3Blue1Brown"
```

**Options:**
- `-c, --channel`: The name or id of the channel to delete (required)

### `export`
Export transcripts for a channel.

This command will create a directory in the current working directory with the YouTube channel id of the specified channel.

```bash
# Export to txt format (default)
yt-fts export --channel "3Blue1Brown" --format txt

# Export to vtt format
yt-fts export --channel "3Blue1Brown" --format vtt
```

**Options:**
- `-c, --channel`: The name or id of the channel to export transcripts for (required)
- `-f, --format`: The format to export transcripts to. Supported formats: txt, vtt (default: txt)

### `search` (Full Text Search)
Full text search for a string in saved channels.

- The search string does not have to be a word for word and match 
- Search strings are limited to 40 characters. 

```bash
# search in all channels
yt-fts search "[search query]" 

# search in channel 
yt-fts search "[search query]" --channel "[channel name or id]" 

# search in specific video
yt-fts search "[search query]" --video-id "[video id]"

# limit results 
yt-fts search "[search query]" --limit "[number of results]" --channel "[channel name or id]"

# export results to csv
yt-fts search "[search query]" --export --channel "[channel name or id]" 
```

**Options:**
- `-c, --channel`: The name or id of the channel to search in
- `-v, --video-id`: The id of the video to search in
- `-l, --limit`: Number of results to return (default: 10)
- `-e, --export`: Export search results to a CSV file

**Advanced Search Syntax:**

The search string supports sqlite [Enhanced Query Syntax](https://www.sqlite.org/fts3.html#full_text_index_queries).
which includes things like [prefix queries](https://www.sqlite.org/fts3.html#termprefix) which you can use to match parts of a word.  

```bash
# AND search
yt-fts search "knife AND Malibu" --channel "The Tim Dillon Show" 

# OR SEARCH 
yt-fts search "knife OR Malibu" --channel "The Tim Dillon Show" 

# wild cards
yt-fts search "rea* kni* Mali*" --channel "The Tim Dillon Show" 
```

# Semantic Search and RAG
You can enable semantic search for a channel by using the `embeddings` command.
This requires an OpenAI or Gemini API key set in the environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY` or `GEMINI_API_KEY`, or 
you can pass the key with the `--api-key` flag. 

### `embeddings`
Fetches embeddings for specified channel

```bash
# make sure API key is set
# export OPENAI_API_KEY="[yourOpenAIKey]"
# or
# export GEMINI_API_KEY="[yourGeminiKey]"

yt-fts embeddings --channel "3Blue1Brown"

# specify time interval in seconds to split text by default is 30 
# the larger the interval the more accurate the llm response  
# but semantic search will have more text for you to read. 
yt-fts embeddings --interval 60 --channel "3Blue1Brown" 
```

**Options:**
- `-c, --channel`: The name or id of the channel to generate embeddings for
- `--api-key`: API key (if not provided, reads from OPENAI_API_KEY or GEMINI_API_KEY environment variable)
- `-i, --interval`: Interval in seconds to split the transcripts into chunks (default: 30)

After the embeddings are saved you will see a `(ss)` next to the channel name when you 
list channels, and you will be able to use the `vsearch` command for that channel. 

### `vsearch` (Semantic Search)
`vsearch` is for "Vector search". This requires that you enable semantic 
search for a channel with `embeddings`. It has the same options as 
`search` but output will be sorted by similarity to the search string and 
the default return limit is 10. 

```bash
# search by channel name
yt-fts vsearch "[search query]" --channel "[channel name or id]"

# search in specific video
yt-fts vsearch "[search query]" --video-id "[video id]"

# limit results 
yt-fts vsearch "[search query]" --limit "[number of results]" --channel "[channel name or id]"

# export results to csv
yt-fts vsearch "[search query]" --export --channel "[channel name or id]" 
```

**Options:**
- `-c, --channel`: The name or id of the channel to search in
- `-v, --video-id`: The id of the video to search in
- `-l, --limit`: Number of results to return (default: 10)
- `-e, --export`: Export search results to a CSV file
- `--api-key`: API key (if not provided, reads from OPENAI_API_KEY or GEMINI_API_KEY environment variable)

### `llm` (Chat Bot)
Starts interactive chat session with a model using 
the semantic search results of your initial prompt as the context
to answer questions. If it can't answer your question, it has a 
mechanism to update the context by running targeted query based 
off the conversation. The channel must have semantic search enabled.

```bash
yt-fts llm --channel "3Blue1Brown" "How does back propagation work?"
```

**Options:**
- `-c, --channel`: The name or id of the channel to use (required)
- `--api-key`: API key (if not provided, reads from OPENAI_API_KEY or GEMINI_API_KEY environment variable)

### `summarize`
Summarizes a YouTube video transcript, providing time stamped URLS. 
Requires a valid YouTube video URL or video ID as argument. If the 
trancript is not in the database it will try to scrape it.

```bash
yt-fts summarize "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-Jl0dxWQs8"
# or
yt-fts summarize "9-Jl0dxWQs8"

# Use different model
yt-fts summarize --model "gpt-3.5-turbo" "9-Jl0dxWQs8"
```

**Options:**
- `--model, -m`: Model to use in summary
- `--api-key`: API key (if not provided, reads from OPENAI_API_KEY or GEMINI_API_KEY environment variable)

output:
```
In this video, 3Blue1Brown explores how large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 
might store facts within their vast...

    â€¢ The video starts by questioning how LLMs store specific facts and                                                      
      introduces the idea that these facts might be stored in a particular part of the                                       
      network known as multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs).

## How To

**Export search results:**

For both the `search` and `vsearch` commands you can export the results to a csv file with 
the `--export` flag. and it will save the results to a csv file in the current directory. 
```bash
yt-fts search "life in the big city" --export
yt-fts vsearch "existing in large metropolaten center" --export
```

**Delete a channel:**
You can delete a channel with the `delete` command. 

```bash
yt-fts delete --channel "3Blue1Brown"
```


**Update a channel:**
The update command currently only works for full text search and will not update the 
semantic search embeddings. 

```bash
yt-fts update --channel "3Blue1Brown"
```


**Export all of a channel's transcript:**

This command will create a directory in current working directory with the YouTube 
channel id of the specified channel.
```bash
# Export to vtt
yt-fts export --channel "[id/name]" --format "[vtt/txt]"
```
